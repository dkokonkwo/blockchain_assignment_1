Question One:

Task 1: Implement SHA-256 Hashing
1.    Objective: Implement the SHA-256 hashing algorithm in C to understand how data integrity is maintained in blockchain.
Submission Requirements:
•    Write a C program that takes a string as input and outputs its SHA-256 hash.
•    Include comments to explain how the SHA-256 algorithm processes the input to produce the hash.
•    Test the program by hashing the input "Blockchain Cryptography".


Task 2: Simple Blockchain Simulation
1.    Objective: Create a basic simulation of a blockchain in C that utilizes hashing for validating integrity.
Submission Requirements:
•    Define a Block structure in C that includes index, timestamp, data, previous hash, and the hash of the current block.
•    Implement a function to calculate the hash of a block and another to validate the chain.
•    Simulate a small blockchain where each new block is added after validating the entire chain.
